                            My skills are centred around full stack developement for web and mobile applications. With many academic and personal projects
                            completed, I have become confident in my ability to effectively use a variety of frameworks and languages 
                            to create stunning and robust software products.

                            In my free time, I enjoy weight training, boxing, tennis, skiing, and mountain biking.
                            I also play complex strategy games like Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition and Clash of Clans at a high level.

                        Every summer, university students begin to think about what courses they want to take in the upcoming school year. 
                        For most, it is a difficult process that can take anywhere from hours to days. Information and resources about 
                        courses are scarce and scattered between different university affiliated websites and social networks. 
                        This capstone project streamlines this process, allowing students to search for courses, leave reviews, interact 
                        in forum discussions, and find all relevant information for university courses, all in one website.
